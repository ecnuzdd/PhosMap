\description{
Some datasets with larger size need to be loaded for mapping ID or protein sequence when using PhosMap.
These datasets could be ragarded as library and uploaded to https://github.com/ecnuzdd/PhosMap_datasets in advance.
When first perfoming functions depending on these datasets, PhosMap will get them from specific URL and save them into local disk.
